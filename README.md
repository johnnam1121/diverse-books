This webapp is made to suggest diverse books and provide teacher resources for each book. 
This website searches through a datalist that is provided in the public folder. It has about 300 entries which limits the amount of searchable books for testing reasons. If this were to be pursued, it can be scaled to search through Google books API as a search engine then search through ccbc.education.wisc.edu diversity book database.
